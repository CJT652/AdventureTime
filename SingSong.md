Paul called over a random penguin. Paul sang his song: 
“MY NAME IS PAUL, AND I’M THE BEST PENGUIN OF ALL! YUP, THE BEST PENGUIN IS ME, WHO REALLY NEEDS TO PEE! I HAVE A PURPLE HEART, BUT I NEED TO FART! YUP! YUP! YUP! MY NAME IS PAUL, AND I’M THE BEST PENGUIN OF ALL!”
The random penguin sang his song about desert all around.
“They are penguins!” shouted one croc. The crocs are Paul right up in one bite.
