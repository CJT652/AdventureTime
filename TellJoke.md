Paul said, “Serious, come over here.”

Serious peaked out from behind a corner. He came over when he saw Paul.

“Guess what?” asked Paul.

“What?” sighed Serious.

“CHICKEN BUTT!!!!!!” shouted Paul. 

“You are definitely not penguins!” said one croc. With that, they ran away and never bothered the penguins again.
