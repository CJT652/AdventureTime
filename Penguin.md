# Paul the desert penguin 
Once upon a time, there was a penguin named Paul who lived in the desert. Paul was a silly penguin, but none of the other penguins appreciated his silliness. One day, he walked up to a penguin named Serious.
	“Hi, Serious!” exclaimed Paul. “I have a joke!” 
	“It’s not the same joke you always say, is it?” asked Serious.
	“No. This one  is a knock- knock joke,” said Paul.
	“Fine then,” said Serious.
“Knock- knock!”
“Who’s there?”
“Cows.”
“Cows who?”
“Cows don’t who. They moo. Or at least I think they do. I’ve never heard one.” 

	The next day, Paul’s mom told him that he had to start Preschool. Paul waddled towards school. Or the direction he thought it was in.
