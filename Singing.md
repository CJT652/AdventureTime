Paul waddled towards singing. He reached the small cave with one big penguin and lots of little penguins.
“Sing us a song,” said the big penguin.
One little penguin sung a song about desert all around.
“Your turn, Paul!” said the big penguin.
Paul thought of the song he had written himself. At the top of his lungs, he sang:
“MY NAME IS PAUL, AND I’M THE BEST PENGUIN OF ALL! YUP, THE BEST PENGUIN IS ME, WHO REALLY NEEDS TO PEE! I HAVE A PURPLE HEART, BUT I NEED TO FART! YUP! YUP! YUP! MY NAME IS PAUL, I’M THE BEST PENGUIN OF ALL!”
