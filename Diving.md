Paul waddled towards diving practice. Twenty little penguins and one big penguin stood by a pit filled with cactuses. 
“Your turn!” said the big penguin to a little penguin.
The penguin made a perfect headfirst dive into the cactuses. 
“Your turn, Paul!” said the big penguin. 
Paul didn’t know how to dive, but he did know how to do a cannonball. He cannonballed into the cactuses.
